## Personal Intro

#### I am just a average boy who was not good with technologies at all, touched pc for the first time After graduated from SeconderySchool & got interest with infosec after Watching movies and other facebook hacking apps on internet

#### After seeing all of these, I start dreaming to become a Hacker. Passed through some useless tpoic as facebook reporting and random youtube videos. Everyone was telling hold on boy, you even don't even owned a computer, everyone laughed, and saying Hacking is not for you go and study academic textbook.
